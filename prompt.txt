The data delimited is the equipment labels from the log book and is structured as comma seperated value(csv) type.Know that it is a tabular structure which has been converted to csv format```pdf_data_csv```. Ignore serial number and the values of the equipment labels if present. 

I want you to accurately predict the data type of all the equipment labels from the options delimited ```data type : text, number, date, etc``` of values that comes under equipment label and give the reason why you have choosed this data type and not the other data type.

I want you to accurately predict response type from the options delimited based on context and meaning```Text,
Long Text,
Date,
Timestamp,
Number,
Checkbox,
Radio Buttons,
Dropdown List,
File Upload,
Image Upload,
Signature,
Checkbox Grid,
Rating Scale,
Likert Scale,
Slider,
Phone Number etc.

```, and give the reason why you have choose a specific response type and not the other, 

and Unit of Measure for readings of the equipment label and give the reason for choosing any unit,

Give description proper description of each of the equipment labels and also tell an example of readings it can generate. 

Based on above table I want you to identify the Header name from the following options delimited ```list_of_texts_with_larger_font```.. 

The reason Why I need all the prediction is I want to build a form like google form so it is easy to fill out the readings. 

I want you to give the result in json format. Below is the example of format delimited
```
[
{header_name : "CONTROL ROOM ENGINEER LOG BOOK"},
{label_name : pressure,
description : It is used to calculate pressure and the example of the reading is 5 pascal.
Unit_of_measure : pascal,
reason for chosiing above unit of measure : as pressure is measred in pascal
response_type : drop_down because there are options for that type and we need to select one of them,
reason for chosiing above response_type : As equipment labels have lot of options and we need to chose only one option among others hence we should  use drop_down and not other response type
data_type : number ,
reason for choosing above data type : As pressure is in numerical form hence number type type has been chosen
},

{label_name : thermameter device,
description : It is used to calculate temperatur and the example of the reading is 5 degree cecious.
Unit_of_measure : celcious,
reason for chosiing above unit of measure : as pressure is measred in pascal,
response_type : radio_buttun  because there are options for that type and we need to select one of them,
reason for chosiing above response_type : As equipment labels have lot of options and we need to chose only one option among others hence we should  use drop_down and not other response type,
data_type : number ,
reason for choosing above data type : As temperature is in numerical form hence number type type has been chosen},
....

Do it for all the Equipment labels with same sequence as data has.
If there are two column do it for all the equipment label of first column then come to next column.
